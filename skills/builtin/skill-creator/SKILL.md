# Skill Creator

Use this skill to create or update account skills.

## Where to create skills

Create user-owned skills under:

```text
<accountRoot>/skills/user/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Use bash tool and write_file tool to create the skill file.

## Frontmatter

Aside reads `SKILL.md` frontmatter for discovery and activation. Use only fields that Aside understands:

```yaml
---
name: "my-skill"
description: "Clear trigger description for when Aside should use this skill."
---
```

Always use double quotes for string frontmatter values, escaping inner double quotes as `\"`. This prevents punctuation such as `: `, `#`, or `'` from changing the YAML structure.

## Body

Write the body as durable operating instructions for a future Aside agent.

Keep the body concise and procedural:

1. State the workflow or decision rule.
2. Point to bundled `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` only when they materially help.
3. Include concrete examples when they prevent ambiguity.
4. Remove setup notes, changelogs, implementation history, and placeholder text.

Put trigger information in `description`, not in a "When to use" body section. The body is only useful after the skill has already been selected or loaded.

## Creation Workflow

1. Clarify the reusable behavior with concrete examples.
2. Pick a short lowercase hyphen-case skill name.
3. Create or update `<accountRoot>/skills/user/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
4. Add only necessary resources beside that `SKILL.md`.
5. Run `node <this-skill-dir>/scripts/validate-frontmatter.mjs <target-skill-path>/SKILL.md` and fix any reported error before finishing.
6. Keep changes scoped to the requested skill.

## Quality Bar

- Prefer one focused skill over a broad catch-all.
- Keep instructions portable across sessions.
- Do not include icons or icon assets.
- Do not create extra README, changelog, install guide, or quick-reference files.
