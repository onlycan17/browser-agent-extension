# Airtable

## Canonical URLs

- Home: `https://airtable.com/`
- Workspace: `https://airtable.com/workspaces/${workspaceId}`

## Working style

- Airtable is ID-driven. Base, table, and view URLs often use IDs like `app...`, `tbl...`, and `viw...`.
- Prefer copying the current URL instead of rebuilding it from visible names.
- Shared views often use `shr...`.
- Forms often end in `/form` and support `prefill_` and `hide_` params.
- Interface pages use `app.../pag...`.
- If a direct link falls back to Home, suspect a permission or share-type mismatch first.
- Re-snapshot after opening a record or changing a view because Airtable swaps panes in place.
