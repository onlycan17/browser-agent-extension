- Repository: `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}`
- Issues: `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}/issues`
- Pull requests: `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}/pulls`
- Issue: `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}/issues/${number}`

## Working style

- Verify the active signed-in account from the avatar when account context matters.
- Prefer direct repo, issue, PR, and notification URLs over the home feed.
- For code review, go straight to the PR and then the `Files changed` tab.
- On file pages, press `y` to switch to a commit-pinned permalink before citing or saving a durable URL.

## Useful shortcuts

- Shortcut help: `?`
- Focus search: `/` or `s`
- Notifications: `g`, then `n`
- Issues: `g`, then `i`
- Pull requests: `g`, then `p`
- Code: `g`, then `c`
- New issue: `c`
- Open selected item: `o` or `Enter`
- Labels: `l`
- Assignee: `a`
- Milestone: `m`
- Reviewer: `q`
- Reference issue or PR: `x`
- Open in `github.dev`: `.`
