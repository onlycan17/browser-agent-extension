# Asana

## Canonical URLs

- Home: `https://app.asana.com/0/home`
- Inbox: `https://app.asana.com/0/inbox`
- My tasks: `https://app.asana.com/0/my_tasks`

## Working style

- Asana is session-based. If redirected to `/-/login?u=...`, keep the encoded `u` and continue after auth.
- Prefer copied task and project links for durable navigation.
- `My tasks` is the safest default surface for assigned work.
- Most task actions happen in the details pane. Re-snapshot after opening a task because the right pane updates in place.
